## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Yarn 4 (`corepack enable`; version pinned in `package.json`)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) and Docker (for local DB and type generation)

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start local Supabase and apply all migrations + seeds
yarn sb:start
yarn sb:reset

# Copy the local env template, then paste "Publishable key" and "Secret key" from `yarn sb:status`
cp .example.env .env.local

# Start the dev server (Turbopack)
yarn dev
```

Restart `yarn dev` after editing `.env.local`: env files are read at startup.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with one of the [test accounts](#test-accounts).

### Environments

Local/test and production settings never share a file.

| Environment | Template | Where values live | Supabase |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Local development | `.example.env` | `.env.local` (gitignored) | Local stack, `http://127.0.0.1:54321` |
| Automated tests (Vitest, Playwright, CI) | `.example.env` (`PLAYWRIGHT_*` section) | `vitest.setup.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — placeholder keys only | Local only — non-local URLs are rejected (`src/lib/supabase/env-safeguards.ts`) |
| Production | Same variable names as `.example.env` | Hosting provider env settings, never in the repo | Production project (Settings → API Keys) |

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase API URL, exactly `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` (local: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Publishable / anon key (browser + server client) |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Secret / service role key — **server-only**, bypasses RLS, read only by `createServiceClient()` in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`; never `NEXT_PUBLIC_` |

All `.env` and `.env.*` files are gitignored; only the `.example.env` template (no secrets) is committed.

### Test accounts

Created by `supabase/seeds/01_users.sql` on every `yarn sb:reset`. Local only — seeds are never applied to production.

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | `admin@softbee.dev` | `Password1` |
| Manager | `manager@softbee.dev` | `Password1` |
| Staff (`worker` role) | `worker@softbee.dev` | `Password1` |

## Architecture

### Data access (`lib/api`)

Each domain gets a folder under `src/lib/api/<feature>/`:

```text
src/lib/api/users/
  index.ts       # Public barrel — components import from here only
  queries.ts     # Read helpers
  mutations.ts   # Write helpers
  types.ts       # Optional aliases and Pick/Omit of generated database types
  mappers.ts     # Only when a value changes at runtime
```

Components import hooks from `@/lib/api/<feature>`. They must not call Supabase, `fetch`, or Axios directly. Domain types alias generated database types. A mapper exists only when a value changes at runtime. See `.cursor/rules/lib-services.mdc`.

### Route protection

`src/proxy.ts` runs `updateSession` (`src/lib/supabase/session.ts`) on every request. It refreshes the Supabase session, reads the verified `user_role` JWT claim (the same claim RLS checks), and asks `getRouteAccess` in `src/lib/route-access.ts` what to do:

| Result | Response |
|--------|----------|
| No session on a protected route | Redirect to `/login` |
| Signed in on `/login` or `/register` | Redirect to `/dashboard` |
| Role not allowed | Rewrite to `/access-denied` with status 403 (the URL stays the same) |

Role-restricted pages also call `requireRouteAccess(ROUTES.X)` from `@/lib/api/auth/server` at the top of `page.tsx`. It re-checks the role from `public.users`, so the page stays protected even if the proxy rules drift: no session redirects to `/login`, and a wrong role redirects to `/access-denied`.

The sidebar (`src/components/layout/app-sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx`) uses the same rules to hide links a role can't open.

The access rules live in `src/constants/index.ts`: `PUBLIC_ROUTES_LIST`, `GUEST_ONLY_ROUTES_LIST` and `ROLE_RESTRICTED_ROUTES`. To restrict a new page, add it to `ROLE_RESTRICTED_ROUTES` and to the matrix in `src/lib/route-access.test.ts`, then call `requireRouteAccess` in its `page.tsx`. A missing or unknown role is denied. Hiding a page is not data security: RLS still decides what each request can read or write.

#### Verify route protection

1. `yarn test` runs the route matrix (`src/lib/route-access.test.ts`), the proxy responses and cookie handling (`src/lib/supabase/session.test.ts`), and the page check (`src/lib/api/auth/server.test.ts`).
2. With `yarn dev` and the seeded [test accounts](#test-accounts): signed out, every app route redirects to `/login`. As `worker@softbee.dev`, `/crew`, `/reports` and `/users` show the access-denied page with status 403, and the sidebar shows only Tracker and Projects. As `manager@softbee.dev`, `/crew` and `/reports` open and only `/users` is denied. As `admin@softbee.dev`, every route opens.
3. Direct API requests ignore the UI. Sign in through `POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=password`, then call `/rest/v1/users` with the access token. Each user, any role, sees only their own row, and the anon key sees none.

### State management

| Concern | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Server data and CRUD | TanStack Query hooks in `lib/api/**` |
| Ephemeral UI state | Zustand stores in `features/<name>/store/` |
| Auth mutations | `useSignIn`, `useSignUp`, `useSignOut` in `lib/api/auth` |

Do not use Zustand for CRUD. Existing Zustand stores under `src/lib/api/**` (`projects`, `project-rates`, `auth` profile) predate this decision: do not add new domain stores or extend them.

See `.cursor/rules/state-manager.mdc` for full patterns.

### UI components

- shadcn/ui primitives live in `src/components/ui/`
- Compose with Tailwind utilities and the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils`
- Add new primitives: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## Supabase

```bash
# Start local Supabase (requires Docker)
yarn sb:start

# Apply migrations + seeds to the local DB (drops local data)
yarn sb:reset

# Apply migrations to the local database
supabase db push

# Apply migrations to the linked hosted project (asks for confirmation)
supabase db push --remote

# Regenerate TypeScript types after schema changes
yarn sb:db:types
```

### Production migrations

> **Warning:** `supabase db push` targets the **local** database. The linked hosted project needs `supabase db push --remote`, and the CLI asks for confirmation.

Production migrations are deployed **manually only**: after the migrations are merged to `main`, the person responsible for the release opens **Actions → Deploy database migrations → Run workflow** with the `main` branch selected (other branches are skipped). Nothing deploys automatically on merge.

1. `validate-db.yml` runs first: all migrations + seeds on a clean database, schema lint, pgTAP tests (`supabase/tests`), DB types.
2. The `deploy` job waits for approval in the `production` GitHub Environment, prints the pending migrations (`db push --dry-run`) and applies them. Seeds are never applied to production.

Repository setup (owner, one time): create the `production` environment under **Settings → Environments**, add required reviewers, and add the `SUPABASE_DB_URL` secret (production connection string) to it.

Manual fallback, by the person responsible for the release:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <production-project-ref>
supabase db push --remote --dry-run   # review pending migrations
supabase db push --remote             # applies migrations only; asks for confirmation. Seeds are not applied
```

Migrations use 14-digit UTC timestamps: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_description.sql`. All tables must have RLS enabled. See `.cursor/rules/supabase-db.mdc` for policy conventions.

## Code quality

- **ESLint** + **Prettier** — run `yarn lint` before committing
- **Husky** pre-commit hooks via lint-staged
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — lint, unit tests, build, secret-leak scan and Playwright safeguards on every PR, plus `validate-db.yml` in parallel: all migrations + seeds on a clean database, `supabase db lint`, pgTAP tests (`yarn sb:test`: seeded test accounts, RLS on every public table), and a check that `src/types/supabase-schema.ts` is up to date
- **DB deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy-db.yml`) — manually triggered, validated, approval-gated `supabase db push` to production from `main`
- Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*`

## AI agent setup

Each team member configures their own AI tool. Every tool reads the same project rules (structure, commands, style, data access, and secrets) from its own instruction file:

| Tool | Instruction files |
|------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex and other `AGENTS.md`-aware agents | `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |

Detailed Cursor rules, referenced by the other files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.cursor/rules/ai-standing-orders.mdc` | Global coding standards |
| `.cursor/rules/state-manager.mdc` | TanStack Query + Zustand patterns |
| `.cursor/rules/lib-services.mdc` | `lib/api` module layout |
| `.cursor/rules/components-ui.mdc` | Component and UI conventions |
| `.cursor/rules/app-nextjs.mdc` | App Router page conventions |
| `.cursor/rules/supabase-db.mdc` | Migrations, RLS, and Postgres functions |
| `.cursor/rules/naming-conventions.mdc` | File and folder naming (`kebab-case`) |
| `epics/` | Feature epics (auth, tracker, workspace layout) |

When you change a shared rule, update every instruction file that states it so the tools stay in agreement.

### Verify your setup

1. `yarn install && yarn test` passes.
2. `yarn dev` starts and `/login` loads without a Supabase env error.
3. `git status` does not list `.env`.
4. Ask your agent: *"What are this repo's rules for data access and secrets?"* The answer should mention importing from `@/lib/api/<entity>` only, no direct Supabase or `fetch` calls in UI, and that `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is server-only.

## Routes and access

| Route | Purpose | Access |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/login`, `/register` | Sign in, registration | Signed out only (signed-in users go to `/dashboard`) |
| `/forgot-password`, `/auth/confirm`, `/auth/update-password` | Password recovery and email links | Public |
| `/access-denied` | Shown when a role can't open a page | Public |
| `/dashboard` | Post-login landing | Any signed-in role |
| `/tracker` | Time tracking | Any signed-in role |
| `/projects` | Projects (read-only for workers, enforced by RLS) | Any signed-in role |
| `/profile` | User profile settings | Any signed-in role |
| `/crew` | Crew management | Manager, admin |
| `/reports` | Reporting | Manager, admin |
| `/users` | User administration | Admin |

Any route not listed needs a session; there is no public-by-default route.

## AI change workflow

How we make a change with an AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf). The agent does the typing; you own the result. Every step ends with a check you do yourself.

Agent rules live in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.windsurfrules`, and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.

### The cycle

#### 1. Plan

Ask the agent to read the relevant code and propose the change **before** it edits anything.

- Give it the goal and the Jira key, e.g. "SBT-43: fix the `set-state-in-effect` lint error in `use-mobile.ts`".
- Check: the plan names the files it will touch and who uses them, keeps the change small, and adds no new dependencies or schema/auth changes without asking.

#### 2. Code

Let the agent make the change on its own branch from `dev` (e.g. `fix/sbt-43-...`).

- Check: no secrets in code, no direct Supabase or `fetch` calls in UI, and file names in kebab-case. See the agent rules.

#### 3. Review the diff

Read every line of `git diff` before you run anything.

- Does the diff do only what the plan said?
- Is the old behavior kept, unless the plan changed it on purpose?
- Are new tests testing real behavior, not just mocks?
- Do the agent's checks pass: `npx eslint <changed files>`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `yarn test`?

#### 4. Run

Check it in the real app, not just in tests.

- `yarn build` passes.
- `yarn dev`, then use the feature the way a user would. Unit tests can't show you this.
- Check the `yarn dev` terminal and the browser console for new errors.

#### 5. Review

Open a PR into `dev` that links the Jira ticket, describes the change, and gives "How to verify" steps. A teammate reviews it. Then move the ticket to **To Review** and add a comment with the PR link.

### Worked example: SBT-43

**Change:** `src/hooks/use-mobile.ts` called `setState` directly inside `useEffect`, which the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint rule flags.

| Step | What happened |
|------|---------------|
| Plan | The agent found the only consumer (`components/ui/sidebar.tsx`) and proposed `useSyncExternalStore` with `matchMedia`, with no new dependencies. The server snapshot returns `false` to keep the old desktop-first render. |
| Code | It rewrote the hook as `subscribe` / `getSnapshot` / `getServerSnapshot` helpers and added `use-mobile.test.ts` (node environment, stubbed `window.matchMedia`). |
| Review the diff | We confirmed `matches` on `(max-width: 767px)` equals the old `innerWidth < 768`, and that cleanup removes the same listener. ESLint, `tsc`, and tests (34) pass. |
| Run | `yarn build` passes. A developer checked it manually: signed in, opened `/dashboard`, and resized the browser across 768px. The sidebar switches between the mobile sheet and the desktop rail, with no new errors in the console or the `yarn dev` terminal. |
| Review | The PR goes into `dev` and links SBT-43. |
